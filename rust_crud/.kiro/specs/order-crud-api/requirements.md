# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST API in Rust for managing orders stored in a SQL Server database. The system includes comprehensive status reporting functionality that sends success/failure notifications to an external mock API endpoint for each operation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to create new orders through a REST endpoint, so that I can add order data to the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to /api/orders with valid order data THEN the system SHALL create a new order record in the SQL Server database
2. WHEN an order is successfully created THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 201 with the created order details
3. WHEN order creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL send a success status to mock.com/api/process/status
4. WHEN order creation fails THEN the system SHALL send a failure status to mock.com/api/process/status
5. WHEN invalid order data is provided THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with validation error details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to retrieve existing orders through REST endpoints, so that I can access order information from the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/orders THEN the system SHALL return a list of all orders from the SQL Server database
2. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/orders/{id} with a valid order ID THEN the system SHALL return the specific order details
3. WHEN a GET request is made with an invalid order ID THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 404
4. WHEN order retrieval succeeds THEN the system SHALL send a success status to mock.com/api/process/status
5. WHEN order retrieval fails THEN the system SHALL send a failure status to mock.com/api/process/status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to update existing orders through a REST endpoint, so that I can modify order information in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PUT request is made to /api/orders/{id} with valid order data THEN the system SHALL update the existing order record in the SQL Server database
2. WHEN an order is successfully updated THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 200 with the updated order details
3. WHEN update succeeds THEN the system SHALL send a success status to mock.com/api/process/status
4. WHEN update fails THEN the system SHALL send a failure status to mock.com/api/process/status
5. WHEN attempting to update a non-existent order THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 404

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to delete orders through a REST endpoint, so that I can remove order data from the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a DELETE request is made to /api/orders/{id} with a valid order ID THEN the system SHALL remove the order record from the SQL Server database
2. WHEN an order is successfully deleted THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 204
3. WHEN deletion succeeds THEN the system SHALL send a success status to mock.com/api/process/status
4. WHEN deletion fails THEN the system SHALL send a failure status to mock.com/api/process/status
5. WHEN attempting to delete a non-existent order THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 404

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all API operations to report their status to an external monitoring service, so that I can track system health and operation success rates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any CRUD operation completes (success or failure) THEN the system SHALL send a status report to mock.com/api/process/status
2. WHEN sending status reports THEN the system SHALL include operation type, timestamp, and success/failure indicator
3. WHEN the status reporting endpoint is unavailable THEN the system SHALL log the failure but continue normal operation
4. WHEN status reporting fails THEN the system SHALL NOT affect the primary CRUD operation response to the client

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API to handle database connection failures gracefully, so that the system remains stable under adverse conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SQL Server database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 503 Service Unavailable
2. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL send a failure status to mock.com/api/process/status
3. WHEN database operations timeout THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
4. WHEN connection pool is exhausted THEN the system SHALL handle requests gracefully with appropriate error responses
